# Covid19 Helpline Info App

We developed a website for people to find Covid-19 Local Helpline Numbers


As people are struggling to find local helpline information for #Covid-19 ( #coronavirus )

We have built an opensource crowdsourcing based system today, where everyone can look up helpline information and add more so that people in need can find help.

Please bookmark this site! üôè

Currently, it only has numbers for #India but anyone can add numbers for their country and state.
